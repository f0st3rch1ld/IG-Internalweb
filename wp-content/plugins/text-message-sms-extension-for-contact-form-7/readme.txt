= Can I add the time or user information in the text to me or my visitor? =

* Yes, you can use [Special mail-tags](https://contactform7.com/special-mail-tags/) in texts for information outside the inputed message (submissions, post related, site related, user related). You can then send info such as time and date or user related information. 

= My contact form is not sending out text messages. How can I fix this? =

* For your contact form to start sending text messages, first ensure that you have a valid Biz Text number. 
* By default, your contact form does not send text messages. You have to fill in specific fields found in the settings of your contact form.
* Those fields are found under the Biz Text SMS tab in your contact form settings. For texts to be sent, you must fill in the visitor phone number field and visitor auto-response field.
* For the visitor phone number field, we recommend using a form tag that contains the phone number field in your contact field (Example: [your-phone-number]).

= What does the visitor nickname field mean under Biz Text SMS tab settings? =

* This field refers to the name displayed in your Biz Text Dashboard. By default, the dashboard will show "Unnamed Customer." 
* We recommend using a form tag that contains the name field in your contact form (Example: [your-name]).

= I am not receiving any email notification texts from the contact form. What is happening? = 

* First, go to the Global Configurations page to see if you have a email notification phone number saved. If not, save a phone number. We recommend using your Biz Text Number.
* Second, go to your specific form settings and go to the Biz Text SMS tab. There is a checkbox with the label "Check to Activate Email Notification Through Text". Ensure that it is clicked and saved.
* See Contact Form 7 documentation for other related email issues.

= I find Contact Form 7 to be too confusing? What are my alternatives? =

* Lucky for you, Biz Text has another easy-to-use, no hassle setup, contact form plugin called [Text Message Contact Form Plugin for Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/text-message-contact-form-biztext/).
